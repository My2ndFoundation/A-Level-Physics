# Period

## Core Idea

The period is the time for one complete cycle of a repeating motion — one full swing of a pendulum, one full rotation, or the passage of one whole wave. A short period means a rapidly repeating event (high frequency).

## Symbol

`T`

## SI Unit

`s` (second)

## Scalar or Vector

Scalar. Magnitude only; positive.

## Definition

The period is the time taken for one complete oscillation, rotation, or wave cycle.

## Related Equations

- $T = 1 / f$ — `T` = period (s), `f` = frequency (Hz).
- $T = 2\pi/\omega$ — `ω` = angular frequency (rad s⁻¹).
- Simple pendulum (small angle): $T = 2\pi\sqrt{L/g}$ — `L` = length (m), `g` = 9.81 N kg⁻¹.
- Mass–spring: $T = 2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$ — `m` = mass (kg), `k` = spring constant (N m⁻¹).
- Circular orbit: $T = 2\pi r/v$ — `r` = radius (m), `v` = speed (m s⁻¹).

## How It Is Measured

Time a large number of complete cycles with a stopwatch (or light gate / data-logger) and divide by the number of cycles, then average over repeats. Timing many cycles greatly reduces the percentage uncertainty caused by reaction time.

## Graphical Meaning

On a displacement–time graph, the period is the time for one full cycle (peak to next equivalent peak). The gradient of a $T^2$ against `L` graph for a pendulum gives $4\pi^2/g$, allowing `g` to be found.
